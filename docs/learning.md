## Python Advanced Topics

### Decorators
```python
def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### Context Managers
- Use `with` statement for resource management
- Implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- Automatic cleanup of resources

### Generators and Iterators
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Lazy evaluation
- Use `yield` keyword
- Generator expressions vs list comprehensions

## Machine Learning Concepts

### Supervised Learning
- **Classification**: Predicting categories
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing feature space
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

### Model Evaluation
- Train/Test split
- Cross-validation
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Overfitting and underfitting

## System Design Principles
