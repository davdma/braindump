## Investing Basics for Beginners

1. Understand financial goals: define whether you're investing for retirement, buying a home, or growing wealth.

2. Key principles:
   - Diversify investments: don't put all your money in one place.
   - Think long-term: avoid trying to time the market, consistency matters.

3. Understand risk:
   - Stocks: higher risk, higher potential return.
   - Bonds: lower risk, lower return.

4. Build a strong foundation:
   - Start with an emergency fund.
   - Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.

5. Consider starting with low-cost index funds as a beginner-friendly option.

6. Keep learning as you go: investing is a continuous learning process.
